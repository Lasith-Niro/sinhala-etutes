<h2>Experience with teams, online developer communities, and large code bases</h2>

    <p>
        I have been worked in some projects collaborating with team members using github. According to my personal experience, it was the easiest way to carry out implementing projects<br>
        with teams.
       Here is my github link  and you can get a clear idea about it.

        Here is the link to one of the projects that I have been completed collaborating with a team in my second year as an undergraduate.<br>

        I'm following google groups while sharing ideas with developers.
        <br>
        Examples:
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/score-community">SCoRe community</a><br>
        <a href="libreoffice-request@lists.freedesktop.org">Libre office community</a>
