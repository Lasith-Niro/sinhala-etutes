<h2>Interest in App Inventor</h2>
<div>

        I started using App Inventor nearly about 3-4 months ago. Already I have completed all the exercises in App Inventor.
    <br>
        Apart from doing those exercises I have done several new projects with
        <ul>
            <li>AccelerometerSensor</li>
            <li>Clock</li>
            <li>TinyDB</li>
            <li>BluetoothClient</li>
            <li>ActivityStarter</li>
            <li>Camera</li>
        </ul>
    and other User Interface components.

    As well as I'm interested in using App Inventor due to it's features. The users friendly GUI's are very attractive. <br>
Also it's coding style using blocks fitting helped me a lot in doing all the new projects.
