<h2>Interest in introductory programming</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        When talking about introductory programming, I’m using MIT open courseware. When I come across with issues in my academic work and during practical work,<br>
        I’m used to learn through the website and also the You tube channel.
        In this course all the things are explained simply and clearly in an attractive manner.
        Examples:
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/"> Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science </a></li>
        <li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/index.htm"> A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python</a></li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    I was able to gain knowledge new experiences through each an every course in <b>MIT opencourseware</b>.
