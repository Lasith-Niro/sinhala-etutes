<h2>Project Details</h2>
<b>Project Title : </b>Searching blocks in the Blocks editor<br>
<b>Brief: </b> When working on bigger projects, it can be rather difficult to find blocks. A way of searching and focusing on certain blocks would be very useful.
<br>
<br>
<h2>The Goal and Objectives</h2>
Implementing a way of searching and focusing on specified blocks.<br>
<ol>
    <li>Improve the prototyping work that has been already carried out.</li>
    <li>Provide search list relevant to the entered block.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
When dealing with complex projects having a large number of blocks, it is very difficult to handle
them due to the reason that there is no specific method to search blocks. It will be easier for the user
to focus on required blocks if there is a way to search them.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Brief introduction to the project</h2>
A prototype search box to a find a required blocks has already been implemented up to now. The main objective is to implement the functionality of the prototype and enhance the usability.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<b>Functional</b>
<ol>
    <li>Providing a search box for the user to enter the required blocks</li>
    <li>Visualizing a search list to display the relevant search results.</li>
</ol>
<b>Non-Functional</b>
<ol>
    <li>Should be easy to use.</li>
    <li>Should be using best web standards</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Main deliverables of the system</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Source codes of the module</li>
    <li>Test cases and test data</li>
    <li>Documentations</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>3rd Party tools and libraries </h2>
